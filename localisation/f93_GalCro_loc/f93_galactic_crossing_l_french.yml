 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0001.name: "Anomalies along the Galactic Crossing"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0001.desc: "Reports of massive gravitational anomalies have surfaced along the Galactic Crossing, shifting unpredictably through deep space. Members of the Galactic Community have deployed scouting fleets to investigate, but details remain scarce. Leaked footage reveals space itself warping around the anomalies, stretching the light of stars into eerie strings around them. Mysterious bursts of incomprehensible signals were detected - then, without warning, all contact was lost. No Government has made any official statements so far."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0101.name: "A galaxy holds its breath"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0101.desc: "A galactic crisis is unfolding. Multiple systems that sat on the Galactic Crossing have gone completely dark. In response, some Members of the Galactic Community have called for an emergency senate session next week, and some alarmists declared the entire Galactic Crossing to be unsafe for travel. Yet, with no clear explanation, many local authorities refuse to enforce travel bans or ignore the reports entirely. Tensions are rising, and all eyes are on the upcoming Senate session."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0101.a: "What horror has arrived in our galaxy?"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0201.name: "Senate Report"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0201.desc: "The session is over, but the air inside the Senate's chambers remains heavy. §R[LastKilledCountryName]§! is now completely gone, wiped from the stars without warning. With more systems falling silent, and yet... the Senate remains divided.\nSome delegates demanded immediate retaliation 'Mobilize now', 'Strike before more worlds are lost!' But just as many hesitated, unwilling to risk open war against an enemy they do not even know. Others, more pragmatic in nature, think: 'Why rush to fight if this Crisis is destroying our rivals for us?' Some empires may even be gambling that they can outlast this crisis, only to seize power once the dust settles."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0201.a: "With no coordinated response, we are left waiting"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0301.name: "Receding of the Abyss"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0301.desc: "The immense gravitational anomalies that had terrorised the Galactic Crossing are retreating. Long-range sensors report their vast distortions moving outward, slipping beyond known space and into the depths of the Shrouded Regions. As they vanish, they leave behind strange scars - regions of space where gravity flickers unpredictably, as if something is trying to maintain an opening ... maybe even to widen it.\n\nYet the crisis is far from over. While the major two anomalies withdraw, fleets continue to pour from the Galactic Crossing. Some worlds are already struggling to hold the line. The Senate remains divided, unwilling or unable to form a coordinated response, leaving desperate worlds to fend for themselves. Beyond the rift, something is still watching - waiting."

 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0401.desc: "For years, $ralis_NAME$ has spread destruction, fracturing the galactic stage and igniting political turmoil. Now, a sector-large gravitational anomaly stirs within the Shrouded Regions - its faint ripples can be felt across the entire galaxy. At the same time the two anomalies that must have destroyed the [LastKilledCountryName] and retreated back into the Shrouded Regions are returning and are tearing open the wounds that they left behind.\n\nTheir true goal is clear now: to ascend into some otherworldly madness. But to rise, they must first drown us all. The time has come to rally, to stand against them before their new creation tears our galaxy apart."

 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0501.name: "The War Plan Debate"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0501.desc: "A petition has gained support across the galaxy, pressuring the Senate §Ymove forward with a resolution§! to go beyond defense coordination and create a full-scale war plan.\nThe proposal includes a post-war framework: enemy assets and systems would be placed under §Yshared administration§!, with their resources used for war relief across all §Ymember states§!. Territories taken during the war would be governed collectively to ensure coordinated rebuilding.\n\nBut not everyone agrees. Some argue that the promise of keeping what is conquered - especially the crisis home systems deep inside the Shrouded Regions - motivates empires to commit fully to the war effort. For them, competition drives progress, and the rewards must match the risks."

There is shame in what we have done, but also relief - relief that no more casualty reports will number in the tens of billions. The destruction of $ralis_NAME$ marks the end of a nightmare that has haunted the galaxy for far too long. May this be the last sacrifice we ever have to make. The war is over, and the mourning can finally begin."

The last remnants of their regime flee into the planet's lower levels, refusing to surrender. But the war is over. The galaxy, at last, can breathe again."

 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0901.name: "The Community's Mandate"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0901.desc: "With the war coming to an end, the Senate turns its attention to the wider territories gained throughout the conflict. Under the terms of the war treaty, signed by all current Community members, systems taken during the fighting are to be handed over to a shared administration for coordinated reconstruction efforts.\n\nSystems that were merely reclaimed by their original owners will remain with them - those empires will of course be eligible for reconstruction aids. But others must give up their gains. While some discontent is expected, the Senate plans to ease tensions with a Reclamation Fund for the most successful contributors to the war effort, ensuring their sacrifices are recognized.\n\nThe planet §Y[f93_ralis_planet.GetName]§! and its system §Y[f93_ralis_planet.System.GetName]§! are controlled by §Y[f93_ralis_planet.Owner.GetName]§!"

 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0902.name: "The Community's Claim"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0902.desc: "With $ralis_NAME$ fully under our control, the Senate demands we abide by galactic law and hand the system, combined with all other territories we reclaimed during the war, over to a shared administration. The handover will take time, as forces and new personnel are deployed, logistics restructured, and the groundwork for long-term Community governance is put in place.\n\nThe planet's advanced technology, once used to defy the black hole's hostility, will aid in rebuilding the galaxy. Scientists see an opportunity to use the planet as an exploration hub for deep space missions into the Shrouded Regions. What lies beyond the thin veil could be made visible - or at least turned into a profitable venture for the conglomerates.\nIf disobeyed, the Community will act harshly, bringing severe consequences. Disobeying the Community and breaking the treaty also brings opportunities - new paths will open, and bold choices could change the course of history. This is the time to decide where you stand."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0902.a: "We hold our promises!"

 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0903.name: "The Community's Request"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0903.desc: "Even though we are under no obligation to do so, the Community has formally asked us to hand $ralis_NAME$, along with any other reclaimed territories, over to a shared administration.\nThe planet's advanced technology to survive the gravitational extremes of the black hole could serve as a foundation for rebuilding efforts across the galaxy. Community officials also see strategic potential in turning $ralis_NAME$ into a hub for future expeditions into the Shrouded Regions, but we could manage this undertaking ourselves too.\nWe are free to decide. But the choice we make now will be remembered - by allies, rivals, and history alike."

 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0905.desc: "Community officials have approached us with a plea: to voluntarily hand over territories seized during the crisis war for shared administration and rebuilding. They cannot demand this - only request it - hoping that the galaxy will uphold the ideals of fairness, collaboration, and long-term stability. These regions, they argue, would be better served under shared oversight while relief efforts and rebuilding begin. While some may see this as a loss, others view it as a chance to lead by example.

Only Community peacekeepers are authorized to stay. Yet, while the Senate watches, we quietly disrupt the process.\nRequests from Community envoys go unanswered. Key infrastructure is 'under review,' and local officials are instructed to delay everything - permits, transport, staffing and administrative logistics. Temporary committees create more hurdles, dragging the process to a halt.\nMeanwhile, we pump dozens of billions into rebuilding $ralis_NAME$ - roads, homes, clinics - sending a clear message that it is our empire, not the Community, that is restoring order. The population, still shaped by wartime ideals, begins to see us as protectors.\nOther empires are close to finishing their handovers, but $ralis_NAME$ remains in limbo, always just out of reach.\nComplaints surface. Community coordinators cry sabotage, but there's nothing they can prove.\nThe delays are nearing their end. The phase of disruption is about to begin."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.1101.name: "Postwar Reconstruction Begins"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.1101.desc: "The last remnants of $ralis_NAME$ have surrendered to the galaxy. As their homeworld fell and their government dissolved, peace negotiations were swift and absolute. Now, the second phase of the treaty has begun, the Community has established neutral administrations across most of the systems handed over in the aftermath of the war. These regions, many of which were hardest hit during the crisis, will be the focus of a coordinated rebuilding effort.\nRelief funds and reconstruction support are being distributed to stabilize these territories and restore basic infrastructure. At the same time, the special fund promised to the war's most successful contributors has been opened, recognizing the empires that played a leading role in ending the threat.\nIn some years, each administered system will hold a referendum to determine its future. Whether to reintegrate with their former empires, seek independence, or align with the powers that liberated them - these decisions will shape the postwar galaxy.\nWhile most systems have already begun their transitions, the handover of $ralis_NAME$ remains ongoing. Logistical bottlenecks and security assessments have delayed full administrative deployment, though Community officials insist the process is proceeding as planned."

 f93_ralis_crisis_event.1102.desc: "The last remnants of $ralis_NAME$ have surrendered to the galaxy. As their homeworld fell and their government dissolved, peace negotiations were swift and absolute. With no treaty in place, territorial control remains with the empires that defeated the crisis. The Senate cannot enforce a postwar settlement - but many systems have still been voluntarily handed over to the Community for neutral administration.\nThese contributions reflect the shared commitment to galactic recovery. Community officials have begun establishing administrations in these systems, focusing efforts on relief and rebuilding.\nAs no treaty was enacted, the relief fund planned as compensation for territorial handovers will not be distributed. However, the Community is exploring ways to recognize and support the empires that chose cooperation over gain.\nIn some years, each Community-administered system will hold a referendum to determine its future. Whether they return to their former empires, claim independence, or align with their liberators."

This unexpected act has surprised many across the galaxy - and earned you recognition as a respected power in the fragile postwar recovery.\nRelief efforts will begin shortly, with $ralis_NAME$ becoming a flagship project in the rebuilding process. The decision may also shape future referendums, as local populations take note of your restraint - and your example.\nSome in the galaxy now speak of your empire as the Galactic Liberator"

The handover was lengthy but smooth, and the Senate has formally acknowledged our cooperation.\nThe planet will now be part of coordinated relief and reconstruction efforts. Our willingness to uphold the law strengthens our position in the postwar order and ensures access to the special Successful Victor support fund for the empires that played leading roles in ending the crisis.\nFor now, $ralis_NAME$ is no longer in our hands.

 f93_ralis_crisis_event.1207.desc: "Community forces, unprepared after months of stalled deployment, were caught off guard when violence spread across $ralis_NAME$. The unrest was blamed on rogue loyalist cells - but these had been seeded and supported by our own networks.\nAs instability spread, we redeployed troops 'to protect civilians' and 'secure infrastructure.' Technically, this violated treaty terms-but with order collapsing, few raised objections. Media coverage portrayed us as swift and responsible, while the Community appeared slow and ineffective. Public opinion shifted.\nMonths later, a temporary civilian council called for an early referendum. Security concerns limited Community Observer's access, but the vote went ahead - delivering overwhelming support for $ralis_NAME$ to remain under our protection. We expect similar results from our other reclaimed territories.\nThe Community filed objections. But there was no clear violation, no single act they could challenge. The handover had simply failed and never took hold. Our rule is now legitimized, and though the treaty still exists on paper, its power ended the day the referendum was held."

 f93_ralis_crisis_event.1208.desc: "Months of delays and legal disputes, combined with intense fighting against terrorist cells, culminated in a final referendum on $ralis_NAME$. The clashes with these terrorist groups, supposedly supported by wartime crisis remnants, stretched the handover period far longer than expected. The situation left the local population feeling uncertain about the Community's ability to take over, pushing them toward a hasty referendum, which was backed by $f93_ralis_liberator$. Despite these challenges, the referendum on $ralis_NAME$ overwhelmingly favored remaining under the $f93_ralis_liberator$ control.\nThe Community has chosen silence over escalation, and the future of $ralis_NAME$ remains in limbo, marked as 'in dispute' by the Council. With the treaty concluded prematurely, no aid arrives - and few foreign entities are willing to invest or engage. Rumors spread that old trade agreements may not be renewed."

 f93_ralis_crisis_event.1209.desc: "The treaty is finished.\n\n$ralis_NAME$ remains under our control. No formal challenges followed. No sanctions, no ultimatum from the Senate. Just silence. The Community has chosen symbolism over confrontation, quietly marking $ralis_NAME$ and the surrounding systems as 'territories in dispute.' It's a label that lets everyone move forward - without agreeing, without escalating.\nBut diplomatic channels grow cold. Meetings are postponed, messages delayed. No galactic aid arrives, as the referendum ended all Community obligations. No galactic-wide economical integration will begin.\nWhen $ralis_NAME$ is mentioned, the room changes subject.\n$ralis_NAME$ is treated as an afterthought, a stain to be ignored. This is their quiet protest, they don't want to have anything to do with $ralis_NAME$. No major foreign contracts of business arrive and we fear that our current trade deals might not be renewed. This could become a major blow to our state's income.\nIf the galaxy refuses to recognize our claim on $ralis_NAME$, we'll have to rely on those who operate in the shadows."

They then cross-referenced the data to ensure the algorithm's viability.\nUsing the refined algorithm, they aligned each piece of data to its point of origin, allowing it to reconstruct a complete timeline for all data points based on dynamic dependencies.\nThe newly generated dataset was then linked to live on-board tachyon telemetry, creating a navigation system allowing ships to traverse the shifting subspace conditions and simulate a path in real-time.\nThe parallel hyperspace network, once only theoretical, has now been confirmed, and updated map charts and the new navigation system to travel it, are now being distributed across the galaxy."

An algorithm aligned the data and reconstructed a rough map for the point in time the data was gathered. This new dataset was then linked to computers on ships that scan the subspace around them, creating a real-time simulation capable of tracking subspace fluctuations with precision as the ship is autocorrecting its trajectory to navigate the fuzzy map.\nThe results were undeniable: the once-theoretical parallel hyperspace network has been confirmed, and updated navigation charts based on these findings are now quietly spreading across the galaxy.\nNow it's undeniable: the once-theoretical parallel hyperspace network has been confirmed, and updated map charts and the new navigation system to travel it, are now being distributed across the galaxy."

There was a body before, but the swelling brain slowly burst free from the skull and pushed outwards. The remains of the spinal cord have been tethered to a feeding-tube ever since, rhythmically pumping Zro into the brainstem.\nThe synapses, bloated and tortured, finally ignited - and the mind cracked open. It stretched into the far fabric of space itself and was widened beyond recognition. It saw what could not be seen.\nCloning is impossible and recreating the procedure only works on $ralis_NAME$, as otherworldly attempts ended in the collapse of the minds.

Further scans uncovered an immense hyperlane structure running through the Relay - The Galactic Crossing. Spanning the entire galaxy, this advanced network blends natural hyperlanes with artificial ones, likely created by a forgotten civilization of immense power."

Xeno-Linguists managed to translate a fragment of the signal: '... for all. The Sanctuary will come for you... Shrouded ... again...'.This discovery is so concerning that the details will not be recorded in our archives. Only a small circle within the government will be informed about the possible encounter with whatever is trapped behind this dead zone. The part about the so-called Shrouded Regions will be made public - of course - but not the cryptic message."

Whatever it is, it reaches far across the galaxy, and we believe it explains how $ralis_NAME$ can traverse around the Shrouded Regions.\nOur navigators warn that if we enter the breach point, we may never find an exit - and could be stranded in hyperspace forever.\nWe've also observed small vessels with large gravitational signatures entering the breach point.
