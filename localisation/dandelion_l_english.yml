Is it §Greal?§! or §Rnot?§!. Shortly after the publication of a first report the artifact was transferd into a private collection. Who orchestrated this is unknown. Despite best efforts the §Ytablet§! could not be found anymore.\n\nThe few images we have display a scene of unity among many strange creatures.

Mysterious bursts of incomprehensible signals were detected - then, without warning, all contact was lost. No Government has made any official statements so far."
