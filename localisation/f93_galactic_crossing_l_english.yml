 f93_galaxy.2.desc: "§LAn allegedly ancient and alien §Ytablet§! was found, it is highly controversial due to dating it or deriving good data from it in any way proofs difficult.\nWithout solid data the scientific community is unwilling to make any definitive statement. Is it §Greal?§! or §Rnot?§!. Shortly after the publication of a first report the artifact was transferd into a private collection. Who orchestrated this is unknown.

 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0001.name: "Anomalies along the Galactic Crossing"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0001.desc: "Reports of massive gravitational anomalies have surfaced along the Galactic Crossing, shifting unpredictably through deep space. Members of the Galactic Community have deployed scouting fleets to investigate, but details remain scarce. Leaked footage reveals space itself warping around the anomalies, stretching the light of stars into eerie strings around them. Mysterious bursts of incomprehensible signals were detected - then, without warning, all contact was lost. No Government has made any official statements so far."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0101.name: "A galaxy holds its breath"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0101.desc: "A galactic crisis is unfolding. Multiple systems that sat on the Galactic Crossing have gone completely dark. In response, some Members of the Galactic Community have called for an emergency senate session next week, and some alarmists declared the entire Galactic Crossing to be unsafe for travel. Yet, with no clear explanation, many local authorities refuse to enforce travel bans or ignore the reports entirely. Tensions are rising, and all eyes are on the upcoming Senate session."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0101.a: "What horror has arrived in our galaxy?"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0201.name: "Senate Report"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0201.desc: "The session is over, but the air inside the Senate's chambers remains heavy. [LastKilledCountryName] is now completely gone, wiped from the stars without warning. With more systems falling silent, and yet… the Senate remains divided.\nSome delegates demanded immediate retaliation ”Mobilize now, strike before more worlds are lost.” But just as many hesitated, unwilling to risk open war against an enemy they do not even know. Others, more pragmatic in nature, think: “Why rush to fight if this Crisis is destroying our rivals for us?” Some empires may even be gambling that they can outlast this crisis, only to seize power once the dust settles."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0201.a: "With no coordinated response, we are left waiting "
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0301.name: "Receding of the Abyss"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0301.desc: "The immense gravitational anomalies that had terrorised the Galactic Crossing are retreating. Long-range sensors report their vast distortions moving outward, slipping beyond known space and into the depths of the Shrouded Regions. As they vanish, they leave behind strange scars - regions of space where gravity flickers unpredictably, as if something is trying to maintain an opening … maybe even to widen it.\n\nYet the crisis is far from over. While the major two anomalies withdraw, fleets continue to pour from the Galactic Crossing. Some worlds are already struggling to hold the line. The Senate remains divided, unwilling or unable to form a coordinated response, leaving desperate worlds to fend for themselves. And beyond the rift, something is still watching - waiting."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0301.a: "We should prepare for the worst."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0301.b: " This is the opportunity of the century"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0401.name: "Secrets of $ralis_NAME$"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0401.desc: "For years, $ralis_NAME$ has spread destruction, fracturing the galactic stage and igniting political turmoil. Now, a sector-large gravitational anomaly stirs within the Shrouded Regions - its faint ripples can be felt across the entire galaxy. At the same time the two anomalies that must have destroyed the [LastKilledCountryName] and retreated back into the Shrouded Regions are returning and are tearing open the wounds that they left behind.\n\nTheir true goal is clear now: to ascend into some otherworldly madness. But to rise, they must first drown us all. The time has come to rally, to stand against them before their new creation tears our galaxy apart."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0401.a: "We were sleeping for too long"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0501.name: "The War Plan Debate"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0501.desc: "A petition has gained support across the galaxy, pressuring the Senate to move beyond defense coordination and create a full-scale war plan.\nThe proposal includes a post-war framework: enemy assets and systems would be placed under shared administration, with their resources used for war relief across all member states. Territories taken during the war would be governed collectively to ensure coordinated rebuilding.\n\nBut not everyone agrees. Some argue that the promise of keeping what is conquered - especially the crisis home systems deep inside the Shrouded Regions - motivates empires to commit fully to the war effort. For them, competition drives progress, and the rewards must match the risks."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0501.a: "For the Galaxy!"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0501.a_desc: "We can now introduce a new §YResolution§! in the galactic senate."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0501.b: "We can't sign this!"

 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0601.name: "The War Plan Treaty"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0601.desc: "The Senate has passed the Resolution, and the War Treaty is currently being signed by the member states. Not everyone is pleased with the outcome of this session - some are even questioning their ties to the Community entirely. First Senators have already declared the withdrawal of their delegations from the Community…"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0601.a: "Where can I sign?"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0601.b: "They don't appreciate our ambitions."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0601.c: "We should reconsider our membership!"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0602.name: "No War Plan Treaty"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0602.desc: "The Senate has not passed the Resolution and there will be no binding treaty on how to deal with the aftermath of this Crisis. Still, quite a few member states have pledged to honor the spirit of the treaty."

 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0701.desc: "A fleet has entered the $ralis_NAME$ System, crossing through the wormholes into the heart of the Shrouded Regions. The Aetherophasic Engine drifts at its center, with the world of $ralis_NAME$ orbiting nearby. This system bears the weight of forgotten history - and now, it may shape what comes next. All eyes turn here."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0701.a: "This is where it ends… One way or another."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0801.name: "The Fall of $ralis_NAME$"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0801.desc: "$ralis_NAME$ has fallen. After brutal fighting, the forces of (invading empire name) have seized control of the planet's major regions. The last remnants of their regime flee into the planet's lower levels, refusing to surrender. But the war is over. The galaxy, at last, can breathe again."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0801.a: "Finally."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0802.name: "The Annihilation of $ralis_NAME$"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0802.desc: "This is the end of a long and bitter war. Too many lives were lost, too many paths left untaken. There is shame in what we have done, but also relief - relief that no more casualty reports will number in the tens of billions. The destruction of $ralis_NAME$ marks the end of a nightmare that has haunted the galaxy for far too long. May this be the last sacrifice we ever have to make. The war is over, and the mourning can finally begin."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0802.a: "This was inevitable."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0901.name: "The Community's Mandate"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0901.desc: "With the war coming to an end, the Senate turns its attention to the wider territories gained throughout the conflict. Under the terms of the war treaty, signed by all current Community members, systems taken during the fighting are to be handed over to a shared administration for coordinated reconstruction efforts.\n\nSystems that were merely reclaimed by their original owners will remain with them - those empires will of course be eligible for reconstruction aids. But others must give up their gains. While some discontent is expected, the Senate plans to ease tensions with a Reclamation Fund for the most successful contributors to the war effort, ensuring their sacrifices are recognized.\n\nThe planet §Y[f93_ralis_planet.GetName]§! and it's system §Y[f93_ralis_planet.System.GetName]§! are controlled by §Y[f93_ralis_planet.Owner.GetName]§!"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0901.a: " It's for the best of all."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0901.b: "This isn't a concern for us."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0901.c: "We will voluntarily hand our systems over. "
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0901.d: ""
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0902.name: "The Community's Claim"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0902.desc: "With $ralis_NAME$ fully under our control, the Senate demands we abide by galactic law and hand the system, combined with all other territories we reclaimed during the war, over to a shared administration. The handover will take time, as forces and new personnel are deployed, logistics restructured, and the groundwork for long-term Community governance is put in place.\n\nThe planet's advanced technology, once used to defy the black hole's hostility, will aid in rebuilding the galaxy. Scientists see an opportunity to use the planet as an exploration hub for deep space missions into the Shrouded Regions. What lies beyond the thin veil could be made visible - or at least turned into a profitable venture for the conglomerates.\nIf disobeyed, the Community will act harshly, bringing severe consequences. Disobeying the Community and breaking the treaty also brings opportunities - new paths will open, and bold choices could change the course of history. This is the time to decide where you stand."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0902.a: "We hold our promises!"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0902.b: "The treaty was more like a guideline anyways… We will keep it!"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0902.b_desc: "$RThis will lead to use being kicked out of the community§!"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0903.name: "The Community’s Request"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0903.desc: "Even though we are under no obligation to do so, the Community has formally asked us to hand $ralis_NAME$, along with any other reclaimed territories, over to a shared administration.\nThe planet’s advanced technology to survive the gravitational extremes of the black hole could serve as a foundation for rebuilding efforts across the galaxy. Community officials also see strategic potential in turning $ralis_NAME$ into a hub for future expeditions into the Shrouded Regions, but we could manage this undertaking ourselves too.\nWe are free to decide. But the choice we make now will be remembered - by allies, rivals, and history alike."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0903.a: "It would be better for all…"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0903.b: "We will not yield to these bureaucrats!"

 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0905.name: "The Community’s Plea"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.0905.desc: "Community officials have approached us with a plea: to voluntarily hand over territories seized during the crisis war for shared administration and rebuilding. They cannot demand this - only request it - hoping that the galaxy will uphold the ideals of fairness, collaboration, and long-term stability. These regions, they argue, would be better served under shared oversight while relief efforts and rebuilding begin.While some may see this as a loss, others view it as a chance to lead by example. The decision is ours."

 f93_ralis_crisis_event.1001.name: "Paper Promises"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.1001.desc: "Publicly, we affirm our intention to comply with the treaty, but behind the scenes, the handover slows.\nOur forces have withdrawn from $ralis_NAME$, as required per treaty. Only Community peacekeepers are authorized to stay. Yet, while the Senate watches, we quietly disrupt the process.\nRequests from Community envoys go unanswered. Key infrastructure is “under review,” and local officials are instructed to delay everything - permits, transport, staffing and administrative logistics. Temporary committees create more hurdles, dragging the process to a halt.\nMeanwhile, we pump dozens of billions into rebuilding $ralis_NAME$ - roads, homes, clinics - sending a clear message that it is our empire, not the Community, that is restoring order. The population, still shaped by wartime ideals, begins to see us as protectors.\nOther empires are close to finishing their handovers, but $ralis_NAME$ remains in limbo, always just out of reach.\nComplaints surface. Community coordinators cry sabotage, but there’s nothing they can prove.\nThe delays are nearing their end. The phase of disruption is about to begin."
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.1101.name: "Postwar Reconstruction Begins"
 f93_ralis_crisis_event.1101.desc: "The second phase of the treaty has begun, the Community has established neutral administrations across most of the systems handed over in the aftermath of the war. These regions, many of which were hardest hit during the crisis, will be the focus of a coordinated rebuilding effort.\nRelief funds and reconstruction support are being distributed to stabilize these territories and restore basic infrastructure. At the same time, the special fund promised to the war’s most successful contributors has been opened, recognizing the empires that played a leading role in ending the threat.\nIn ten years, each administered system will hold a referendum to determine its future. Whether to reintegrate with their former empires, seek independence, or align with the powers that liberated them - these decisions will shape the postwar galaxy.\nWhile most systems have already begun their transitions, the handover of $ralis_NAME$ remains ongoing. Logistical bottlenecks and security assessments have delayed full administrative deployment, though Community officials insist the process is proceeding as planned."
