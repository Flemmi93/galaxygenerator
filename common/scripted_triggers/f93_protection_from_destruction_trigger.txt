# This Trigger is specifically to prevent OUR mod's system  destruction event from triggering on a system
# this destruction even is f93_ralis_crisis_event.0103 It is occasionally edited but all calls
# for this event should include this trigger.
# Use it as follows
# Example:
# random_system = {
# 	limit = { f93_ok_to_be_destroyed = yes }
# 	system_event = { id = f93_ralis_crisis_event.0103 }
# }
# The Example above would destroy a random system except those that are protected by this trigger
# since it will only choose a random system that is ok to be destroyed.


#I can add star and planet flags to this without any issue, if you want any flag added to this
# let me know via discord or our mod page on steam.

				has_planet_flag = earth_nuked
				#special system init systems we intent to protect

				#If you only have a planet that should be protected add it here and the entire system will be safe from me.
